Description: Collectd-web is a web-based front-end for RRD data collected by collectd
 Collectd-web is a web-based front-end for RRD data collected by collectd.
 It is based on contrib/collection.cgi, a demo CGI script included in collectd.
 .
 The main objective of this is to develop an easy to use and customizable web
 interface for Collectd (Resource monitoring software).
 Two days of research where enough to realize that collectd didn't have a real
 frontend and the one bundled with the backend was really made for testing purposes,
 so much of the usability and strength of statistics was left aside.
 .
 With strong emphasis on the usage of JQuery and JQueryUI,
 Collectd-Web manages to give sysadmins a nice yet functional interface for web
 and mobile UI too!
