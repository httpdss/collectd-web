Welcome to Collectd-web's documentation!
========================================

The main objective of this is to develop an easy to use and customizable web interface for Collectd (Resource monitoring software).

Two days of research where enough to realize that collectd didn't have a real frontend and the one bundled with the backend was really made for testing purposes, so much of the usablility and strength of statistics was left aside.
