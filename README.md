# Collectd-web: A User-Friendly Interface for Collectd

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

Collectd-web provides a sleek, intuitive, and customizable web interface for Collectd – the robust resource monitoring tool. Originally, Collectd’s bundled frontend was designed only for testing, leaving its full potential untapped. Collectd-web bridges that gap by offering an efficient, user-centered experience for monitoring system statistics.
